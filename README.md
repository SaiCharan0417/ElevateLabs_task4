#  SQL for Data Analysis — Internship Task 4

## 📋 Objective

The goal of this task is to apply SQL for real-world data analysis — extracting, manipulating, and summarizing structured data from an **E-commerce database** (or any equivalent dataset). This helps develop hands-on skills in querying, analyzing, and optimizing data using SQL.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **MYSQL**

## 🔍 Key SQL Concepts Used

* **SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY** — for filtering and sorting data
* **Aggregate Functions** — `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()` for summarizing data
* **Subqueries** — for nested data retrieval
* **Views** — for reusable query results
* **Indexes** — for query performance optimization

## 💡 Learnings

* Strengthened understanding of SQL query writing and optimization
* Practiced analytical thinking through real-world e-commerce data scenarios
* Understood how to prepare SQL deliverables for professional projects
