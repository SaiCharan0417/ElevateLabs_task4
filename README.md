# DATA ANALYTICS INTERNSHIP TASK-4
#  SQL for Data Analysis

## Objective
* The goal of this task is to apply SQL for real-world data analysis — extracting, manipulating, and summarizing structured data from an **E-commerce database** (or any equivalent dataset). This helps develop hands-on skills in querying, analyzing, and optimizing data using SQL.

## Tools & Technologies
* **MYSQL**

## Key SQL Concepts Used
* **SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY** — for filtering and sorting data
* **Aggregate Functions** — `SUM()`, `AVG()`, 'MAX()','MIN()' for summarizing data
* **Subqueries** — for nested data retrieval
* **Views** — for reusable query results
* **Indexes** — for query performance optimization

## DATASET
* ecommerce.csv from KAGGLE

## KEY LEARNINGS
* Strengthened understanding of SQL query writing and optimization
* Practiced analytical thinking through real-world e-commerce data scenarios
* Understood how to prepare SQL deliverables for professional projects
